    FinBots helps to earn money using algo trading.
    Algo trading is a type of trading when operations are made with special software or trading bots.
    Bot makes operations using programming strategies or getting signals.`,

    question2: "How does it work?",
    answer2:`
    Trading bot is a program that makes operations automatically.
    Other words, a bot does exactly what you do manually.
    For that process you put in some parameters, like share ticker, number of lots and strategy.
    By strategy I mean the source with signals.
    The only left for you is monitoring your bot deals in the dashboard.`,
